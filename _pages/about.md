My research focuses on the magnetic field sensitive photochemistry of [flavin molecules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flavin_group) in various locales, ranging from solution to protein-bound to intracellular. The origin of magnetic field effects arises from the entangled and coherent properties of [radical pairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_chemistry). Studying such phenomenon requires the development of sensitive techniques and this lies at the heart of my research.
