Tutorial lecture on animal magnetoreception to Sendai Seiryo Secondary School (仙台市立仙台青陵中等教育学校) 1st and 2nd grade students for the [JSPS Science Dialogue](https://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-plaza/e-sdialogue/FY2019.html).

Every  year,  animals  migrate hundreds  of  kilometers  to escape the colder  months.  Their  ability  to navigate  over  great  distances  is  made possible  by  magnetoreception  –  the  animals’  ability  to detect  the  direction  of  the  Earth’s  magnetic  field.  The  mechanism  behind  this  sixth  sense  is  still unclear.  Current  evidence  suggests  ‘cryptochrome’,  a  light-sensitive  protein found in the  retinae of  birds  (and  other  animals),  plays  a  role  in  magnetoreception.  The  processes  involved  in  the cryptochrome photoreaction are still  unclear.  My  research focusses  on trying  to  shed  light  on these processes  to allow  a  better  understanding of  animal  magnetoreception.
