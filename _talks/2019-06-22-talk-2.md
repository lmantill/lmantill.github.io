Tutorial lecture on photochemistry to Japanese highschool students for the [HiGEPSオープニング基礎セミナー](http://www.saitama-u.ac.jp/sci/news/2019-0518-23.html).

Imagine you are walking through the park in spring, viewing the cherry blossoms.　We know that light reflects off the flowers to your eyes and informs you that they are pink, but what is light, exactly? This lecture will discuss the answers to this question and their impact on society.
