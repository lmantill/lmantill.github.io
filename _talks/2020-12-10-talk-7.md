Tutorial lecture on photochemistry to Saitama University 1st year students for the [HiSEP特別セミナー](http://www.saitama-u.ac.jp/sci/topix/detail/2020-1125-2254-31.html).

Imagine you are walking through the park in spring, viewing the cherry blossoms.　We know that light reflects off the flowers to your eyes and informs you that they are pink, but what is light, exactly? This lecture will discuss the answers to this question and their impact on society.
